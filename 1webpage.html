    <h1>Just a few things about Naruto</h1>Just a few things about Naruto.


    <h3>
        <p>Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi
    Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks
    recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of
    his village. </p>
    <h6>
        <li>suplimental information</li>
    <li>manga are essentially Japanese comic books</li>
    <li>ninja in Naruto are known as shinobi and are the primary focus and the main military power in the series. </li>
    </h6>

    <p>One of the main themes in Naruto is that through hard work and
    determination, even the greatest hardships can be overcome, but there is one
    shinobi that represents this better than the protagonist himself. In a
    community full of exceptional shinobi, Rock Lee stands out as Konoha's most
    amazing.</p>

    <h6>
        <li>Naruto's way of the ninja is to never give up. NEVER.</li>
    <li>Rock Lee, mentioned above, has no skill in anything that makes a ninja
        a ninja other than taijutsu, which is hand to hand combat.</li>
    </h6>
    
    <p>Naruto taught us a lot but the most important thing he taught us is
    to NEVER GIVE UP in life and what ever you want to achieve will not come to
    you , you have to work your way though. It will be a very tough road ahead
    but make that road fun , make a few friends and smile your way through it.</p>
    <h6>
        <li>as mentioned earlier Naruto's nendo, or way of the ninja, is 
            to never give up. He will always keep his promise and will never
            go back on his word.
        </li></h6>
    <p>The word naruto refers to a powerful whirlpool formed by the meeting of two
    opposing tidal currents in this specific strait. This natural phenomenon has
    long captured the imagination of the Japanese people, leading to its
    association with the name Naruto. </p>
    <h6>
        <li>The ninja in The hidden Leaf Village wear a swirl symbol on 
            their ninja uniforms.  This swirl is a symbol of the Uzumaki
            clan that Naruto is descended from.
        </li>
        <li>Uzumaki means whirlpool or maelstrom.</li></h6>
    
    <p>Never Underestimate me, I don't quit, I
    never run! After Naruto finds out that he might fail the Chunin exams and
    stay Genin longer, this is his reaction. Funnily enough, he does fail his
    Chunin exam and stays a Genin for majority of his Shinobi career, before he
    is inaugurated as a Hokage. This line gives the audience three important
    lessons, firstly do not give up, no matter how hard the situation ahead
    looks. Secondly, just because you don’t give up, doesn’t mean you will not
    fail and lastly, just because you failed does not mean, you won’t make it.
    It’s the mindset that’s important, not the success.</p>
    <h6>
        <li>Naruto is just a badass with a badass attitude, as explained just above.</li>

    </h6>
    
    <p>Dattebayo! (Believe it!)
    “Dattebayo!” is Naruto’s official motto in life. It is the only ideology he
    believes in. The audience has heard this line millions of times by now. This
    is one of the most repeated lines in the show. The line is very impactful
    and a reminder for everyone that no matter how hard a situation is, believe
    in yourself and do not give up. “Dattebayo!” completely covers Naruto’s
    character and his motives. It is a very inspirational line with an important
    message for everyone. It serves as a reminder to all of us that you have to
    stay positive and commit to our goals and dreams. </p>
    <h6>
        <li>DATTEBAYO!!!</li>
        <li>If Naruto says dattebayo(Believe it) then consider it done.</li>
    </h6>
    
    <p>Conclusion Naruto is a
    series filled with inspirational quotes, monologues and characters. Every
    episode the audience gets to hear something that will just make them think.
    But to compress it down in one line, the main theme of the show is to
    persevere through hardship and tensions. The show teaches us to never give
    up and stay loyal, honest and work hard towards your goals. Problems, pain,
    sorrows, depression, and all of the negativity will come your way as you
    journey through this life but they are not the constant, they are the
    obstacles that you must cross.</p>

        <li>The conclusion, I neglected to mention that Naruto is DOPE!</li>
